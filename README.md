# Relearning Python Journey 
The objective in this is to relearn python; I used to be pretty g back ibn highschool at programming, kinda lost it through college and picked up R along the way but if i want to be better at coding in general it seems imperative to go back to python.
 General objectivoes: 

1. Remember Syntax
2. Learn how to plot stuff
3. Learn how to opperate data frames and ts objects
4. Learn how to do requests, though this seems like a whole nother beast.
